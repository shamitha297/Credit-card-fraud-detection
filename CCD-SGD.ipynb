    "# Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Crisp DM Approach\n",

    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit Card Fraud Detection is a classic class-imbalance problem where the number of fraud transactions is much lesser than the number of legitimate transaction for any bank. Most of the approaches involve building model on such imbalanced data, and thus fails to produce results on real-time new data because of overfitting on training data and a bias towards the majoritarian class of legitimate transactions. Thus, we can see this as an anomaly detection problem. \n",

    "The __SGD classifier (Stochastic Gradient Descent)__ is a linear classifier used for classification problems, including binary classification. It is a popular algorithm for large-scale machine learning tasks as it can handle large datasets efficiently.SGD classifier works by updating the model's weights using a gradient descent optimization algorithm that updates the weights incrementally for each training example, rather than computing the gradient over the entire dataset. This makes it particularly efficient for large datasets. It also allows the model to make online predictions, meaning it can make predictions on data as it comes in, without having to wait for the entire dataset to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SGD classifier is flexible in terms of the loss function it can optimize. It can optimize loss functions such as hinge loss, logistic loss, and squared loss, making it suitable for a range of tasks. In terms of hyperparameters, the SGD classifier has several parameters that can be tuned to optimize performance, such as the learning rate, the regularization parameter, and the type of penalty used for regularization. The optimal combination of hyperparameters can be found using methods such as grid search or randomized search.\n",
    "\n",
    "In credit card fraud detection, the SGD classifier can be used to build a model that learns to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions based on features such as transaction amount, location, time of day, and so on. The classifier can then be used to predict the probability of fraud for each transaction and flag those transactions that are most likely to be fraudulent."

    "The code snippet shows the evaluation of a trained SGDClassifier model using the evaluation() function. The function takes in the test set (y_test, X_test) and the trained model (grid_sgd). The classification report shows the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (0 and 1), as well as the accuracy, macro-average, and weighted-average F1-score. The AUC-ROC score and F1-score are also shown. The precision for class 0 is 1.00, meaning that all the predicted negative instances are actually negative, while the precision for class 1 is 0.14, indicating that only a small percentage of predicted positive instances are actually positive. The recall for class 0 is 0.99, meaning that almost all the actual negative instances are correctly classified, while the recall for class 1 is 0.91, indicating that the model is able to identify a large proportion of positive instances. The F1-score for class 0 is 1.00, indicating a perfect balance between precision and recall, while the F1-score for class 1 is 0.25, indicating poor performance for positive instances. The accuracy of the model is 0.990, meaning that the model is able to correctly classify almost 99% of the instances. The AUC-ROC score is 0.948, which is a good indicator of the overall performance of the model. Overall, the model seems to perform well for negative instances, but not so well for positive instances."

Therefore, it is not surprising that the evaluation metrics you printed are also very low. The AUC-ROC score of 0.5 indicates that the model's predictions are no better than random guessing, while the F1-score and accuracy score of close to zero indicate that the model is not able to correctly classify any samples. In this case, it seems that the model is not well-suited to the data, and simply trying to tune the hyperparameters or change the algorithm may not be sufficient to achieve good performance. It may be necessary to re-evaluate the data or consider alternative modeling approaches. The accuracy of the classifier can be improved by tuning the hyperparameters of the SGDClassifier. We tried changing the learning rate, the number of iterations, or the regularization strength to see if the performance improves. "

The model has an accuracy of 96.14%, indicating that it correctly classified 96.14% of the transactions in the test set. However, the precision for the minority class (fraudulent transactions) is low at 0.04, indicating that the model has a high false positive rate. The recall for the minority class is high at 0.90, indicating that the model has a low false negative rate. The code is evaluating the best model selected by the GridSearchCV by passing the test set and the grid search classifier to the evaluation() function. The y_test parameter is the target variable test set, the grid_search parameter is the grid search classifier selected, and the X_test parameter is the input feature test set."
