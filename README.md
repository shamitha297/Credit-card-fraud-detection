# Credit-card-fraud-detection
Implemented five Machine Learning algorithms from scratch and compared them with scikit-learn library implementations.

The file names are self-explanatory. We used the following machine learning algorithms to compare and analyze.

1. Logistic Regression
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest

The link for the dataset can be found in the files.
